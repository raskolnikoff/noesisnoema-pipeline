## Overview (Updated 2025-06)
**noesisnoema-pipeline** is a minimal, practical pipeline for:

1) **Fetching GGUF LLMs via the Hugging Face CLI** – to run with llama.cpp–compatible runtimes on iOS/desktop/server.
2) **Building a RAGpack (chunks + embeddings)** – split documents, embed them, and ship as a `.zip` your apps can load.

## What you can do here

🎥 **Demo video**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/XT_cp066NRE)

- Safely download **GGUF** (often quantized) community models from Hugging Face.
- Produce a **RAGpack v1.2** (`chunks.json`, `embeddings.npy`, `citations.jsonl`, `manifest.json`) embedded with a llama.cpp GGUF model and importable by NoesisNoema v0.4+.
- Validate corpus chunks before embedding and emit `quality_report.json` so OCR garbage and publisher back matter do not enter the pack.
- (Optional) Execute the same workflow on **Google Colab** using our helper notebook.

> **RAGpack v1.2 (current).** Chunks are embedded with `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`
> via `llama-cpp-python`; the manifest's `embedder.model_hash` is the **SHA-256
> of the embedder GGUF file bytes**, which the NoesisNoema app validates on
> import (ADR-0011 §3). v1.1 packs (sentence-transformers) are deprecated and
> not importable by app v0.4+. See the **[1.2]** changelog and migration note
> at the bottom of this file.

### NEW: RAGpack v1.1 Features
- **Precise Citations**: Paragraph boundaries, character offsets, and optional span‑level source mapping for highlighting.
- **Rich Metadata**: Embedder version, chunker parameters, indexing timestamps, and source diversity metrics.
- **Preview Support**: Snippet extraction with context for DeepSearch UI and API.
- **Validation**: Built‑in CLI validation with `nn-pack validate` including schema checks.
- **Backward Compatible**: Automatically handles v1.0 RAGpacks with clear deprecation warnings.

## Step‑by‑step

### 0) Requirements
- macOS / Linux (Windows works best via WSL)
- Python 3.10+ (CLI usage also works on 3.8+)
- `git`

### 1) Hugging Face account & access token
1. Create an account: https://huggingface.co/join  
2. Issue a token: **Settings → Access Tokens → New token**  
   - **Role**: *Read*  
   - Prefer **Fine‑grained** and enable **Gated repos: Read** (required for Meta Llama and other gated repos).
3. For gated models, visit the model page and **Accept** the license/usage policy.

### 2) Install the CLI and log in
```bash
python -m pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
# or, if you prefer pipx
# pipx install 'huggingface_hub[cli]'

huggingface-cli login    # paste your token when prompted
huggingface-cli whoami   # sanity check
```

> For faster downloads, enable the HF Transfer extension:
> ```bash
> python -m pip install -U hf_transfer
> export HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1
> ```

### 3) Download a GGUF model (recommended: `huggingface-cli download`)
```bash
huggingface-cli download janhq/Jan-v1-4B-GGUF-Q4_K_M \
  --include "*Q4_K_M.gguf" \
  --local-dir models/jan-v1-4b
```

- **TinyLlama (lightweight / quick check)**
```bash
# Example community GGUF repo
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF \
  --include "*Q4_K_M.gguf" \
  --local-dir models/tinyllama-1.1b
```

**Verify**
```bash
ls -lh models/<your_model_dir>
shasum -a 256 models/<your_model_dir>/*.gguf   # optional integrity check
```

> **Why the CLI over `git clone`?**  
> Large LFS repos often include many artifacts you don’t need. `huggingface-cli download --include` pulls only what you ask for and avoids common failures/timeouts.

### 4) Build a RAGpack (chunks + embeddings)
Use the notebook under `notebooks/` to turn your documents into a self‑contained **RAGpack**. Output files:
- `chunks.json` — split text using improved token-based chunking
- `embeddings.npy` — NumPy embeddings (fast to load)
- `embeddings.csv` — CSV embeddings (easy to load from Swift/iOS, etc.)
- `metadata.json` — enhanced with chunking parameters

The chunker now uses **token-based splitting** with configurable overlap instead of simple character-based splitting:
- **Chunk size**: Configure in tokens (default 512) for better LLM compatibility
- **Overlap**: Configurable token overlap (default 50) for context preservation
- **Smart boundaries**: Attempts to break at sentence boundaries when possible
- **Unicode support**: Proper handling of non-ASCII text, emojis, and multiple languages

For more details, see `chunker/README.md`.

> RAGpack is model‑agnostic and independent of the GGUF download step.

### Corpus quality validation

Before final pack generation, the CLI runs a deterministic corpus quality gate
over produced chunks. Accepted chunks continue to embedding and pack writing;
rejected chunks are excluded. This stage belongs to the pipeline because it
controls corpus production quality. Retrieval-time behavior, vector search,
MMR, query processing, prompt generation, and NoesisNoema runtime logic are not
changed.

The current checks are heuristic and document-agnostic:
- OCR garbage signals: excessive symbol density, repeated punctuation, abnormal
  token repetition, isolated uppercase stamp-like fragments, very low
  alphabetic ratio, and suspicious OCR noise tokens.
- Publisher back matter signals: publisher catalogues, advertisements, book
  lists, unrelated title collections, and end-of-book marketing pages.

Each build writes `quality_report.json` beside the pack artifacts. The report is
machine-readable JSON with fields such as:

```json
{
  "quality_report_version": "1.0",
  "total_chunks": 12,
  "passed_chunks": 10,
  "warning_chunks": 1,
  "rejected_chunks": 1,
  "warnings": {},
  "rejection_reasons": {
    "publisher_back_matter": 1
  }
}
```

The manifest includes backward-compatible quality metadata:
`quality_report_version`, `validation_timestamp`, and a compact
`corpus_quality` summary pointing to `quality_report.json`. Future checks can be
added by extending `quality/corpus_quality.py`; the gate already aggregates
per-rule warnings and rejection reasons without exposing document contents in
logs.

## Optional: run on Google Colab
You can do the same on Colab using the helper notebook. Choose a `repo_id` and download `.gguf` files directly to a mounted Google Drive folder or local Colab storage.

**Notebook**: `gguf_downloader_colab.ipynb`  
Usage:
1. Upload the notebook to Colab and run the first cell to install dependencies.
2. (Optional) Mount Google Drive if you want to persist models.
3. Log in with your HF token (fine‑grained, Read; enable *Gated repos: Read* if necessary).
4. Enter the `repo_id` of the model you want.
5. The notebook lists `.gguf` files → choose one → **Download**.

---

### Interactive notebook (Colab or local Jupyter)

For an interactive build flow with step-by-step verification, see
`notebooks/build_ragpack_v1_2.ipynb`. Open it directly in Colab via:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rag-fish/noesisnoema-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/build_ragpack_v1_2.ipynb)

The notebook wraps `cli.build_ragpack.run_pipeline_v12()` with cells for
dependency install, GGUF fingerprint verification, source upload, and zip
download. It produces the same v1.2 RAGpack as the CLI.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **403 Forbidden (gated)**: Accept the license on the model page and ensure your token allows **Gated repos: Read**.
- **Nothing downloads / 404**: Double‑check `repo_id` and make sure the repo actually contains `.gguf` files.
- **Slow/unstable**: Install `hf_transfer` and set `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1`. Use `--resume-download` to continue interrupted downloads.
- **Colab disk limits**: Mount Google Drive and set `--local-dir` to a Drive folder.

## [1.2] - 2026-06
RAGpack **v1.2** — interop with NoesisNoema app v0.4+ (ADR-0011 §5; app-side PRs #97/#98).

### Changed
- **Embedder switch → llama.cpp**: chunks are embedded with
  `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` via `llama-cpp-python` (`embedder/llamacpp_embedder.py`,
  768-dim) instead of `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim).
- **GGUF file-hash identity (ADR-0011 §3)**: `embedder.model_hash` is now the
  **SHA-256 of the embedder GGUF file bytes** — the fingerprint the app
  validates on import — not a config-dict hash. For
  `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q5_K_M.gguf` this is
  `0c7930f6c4f6f29b7da5046e3a2c0832aa3f602db3de5760a95f0582dbd3d6e6`.
- **CLI default is v1.2**: `nn-pipeline build` defaults to
  `--embedder llama-cpp --gguf <path>` (or `NOESIS_EMBEDDER_GGUF`).

### Added
- **`schemas/manifest_v1_2.json`** (schema delta vs v1.1):
  - `pack_version` const `"1.2"`
  - `embedder.required` adds `pooling` and `l2_normalized`
  - `embedder.pooling` enum `["mean"]`; `embedder.l2_normalized` const `true`
  - `embedder.dtype` enum `["float32"]` (was free-form in v1.1)
  - optional `embedder.runtime` (e.g. `"llama.cpp"`)
- Document task prefix `"search_document: "` applied to every chunk
  (nomic-embed-text-v1.5 requirement); explicit L2 normalization of all vectors.
- Citations normalized to the app's RAGpackReader spec
  (`chunk_index` / `char_start` / `char_end` / `page` / `paragraph_boundaries`).

### Deprecated
- `DeterministicEmbedder` (sentence-transformers) and the
  `--embedder sentence-transformers` CLI path: they emit **v1.1** manifests,
  **not importable by NoesisNoema v0.4+**. They warn on use and will be removed
  in a follow-up cleanup PR.

### Migration
Existing **v1.1 packs are not consumable by NoesisNoema v0.4+**. Regenerate with
the v1.2 CLI:

```bash
nn-pipeline build \
  --input_dir  ./docs \
  --output_dir ./ragpack \
  --gguf       ./models/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.Q5_K_M.gguf \
  --creation_time 2026-06-09T00:00:00
# (defaults: --embedder llama-cpp, pack_version 1.2)
```

The GGUF you build with must be byte-identical to the one the app ships, or the
app will reject the pack on the `embedder.model_hash` check.
